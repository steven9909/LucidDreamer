# LucidDreamer

Source code will not be uploaded as I am plannning on uploading this app to the appstore once I get my hands on an EEG sensor that I can use to cross validate my deep sleep detection algorithm (should be soon hopefully). The app uses the standard MVC design pattern and some screenshots will be posted below of the app. 

Below is the screen recording of the application running on the simulator. Note that due to the limit of the simulator, some of the features that are working on a real device does not work on the simulator (such as WatchSession's tranferFile() method to listen to audio recordings on the watch app, settings sync between IOS and watch app, etc...) Also the below appearances and flow is prelimiary and may be changed.
